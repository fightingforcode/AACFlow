# AACFlow
Anticancer peptides (ACPs) have natural cationic properties and can act on the anionic cell membrane of cancer cells to kill cancer cells. Therefore, ACPs has become a potential anticancer drug with good research value and prospect. In this paper, we propose AACFlow, an end-to-end model for identification of ACPs based on deep learning. End-to-end models have more room to automatically adjust according to the data, making the overall fit better and reducing error propagation. The combination of attention augmented convolutional neural network (AAConv) and multi-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) forms a deep representation learning module, which is used to obtain global and local information of sequences. Based on the concept of flow network, multi-head flow-attention mechanism is introduced to mine the deep features of sequences to improve the efficiency of the model.
